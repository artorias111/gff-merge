# GFF Merge
I wrote this script to combine gff(3) files generated by BRAKER (https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER) and EarlGrey (https://github.com/TobyBaril/EarlGrey), to view potential TE accumulation within gene introns of intrest. Note that this script will not work in situations where the feature IDs in your two files have a similar naming scheme. This is a simple merge and sort method to combine two gff3 files, preserving headers and header structure. 

## Usage 
It's straightforward to run if you have nextflow installed. You provide 3 parameters, a species ID (for file name), a `braker_gff`(gff3), and a `repeat_gff`(gff3)
```shell
nextflow run artorias111/FeatureFlow --species_id hsapien134 --braker_gff /path/to/braker/braker.gff3 --repeat_gff /path/to/eg/repeats.gff
```
